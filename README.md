What is the Project I made?
I made an app called "Shopping+", which is an online shopping list you can use so you don't forget any items while you're out on your errand runs.

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mongoose, Express, dotenv, methode-override, and ejs.

Approach Taken:
- Start by laying out my ideas with a wireframe
- Create my controllers, views, and models folders
- Download all dependencies
- Create my first route and make sure i'm connected to the server
- Create my model
- Build basic index page
- Continue creating my .ejs files and routing them
- Create my Public folder and start working on my CSS styling

Unsolved Problems:
- CSS issues with buttons and forms

User Stories:
- As a user who has to run errands, I want to be able to create a list of the things I have to get, so that I can stay organized and not forget anything I need to buy.
- As a user who may change their mind, I want to be able to remove or edit an item on my list
- as a user I want to be able to give each item a description so I can add a brand type or any specialized information to help me on my search while im shopping.
- as a user i want to be able to add an image of the items incase I want to give someone else my list so that it's easier for them to find the item

Notes:
- Add a login Page
- Add a create list option
- Add a budget calculator
- Add a clear list button
